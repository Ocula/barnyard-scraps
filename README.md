# Barnyard Scraps
## About
Heavy backend system for creating [Barnyard Games](https://www.roblox.com/groups/11323634/Barnyard-Games#!/about) projects. A robust system that should make development on games much quicker with UI presets, game presets, and more. Powered by [Knit](https://github.com/Sleitnick/Knit), [Nevermore](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine), and [Fusion](https://github.com/elttob/Fusion). The general idea is that as time goes on, the more games that are developed via the Scraps system, the more that this backend will be fleshed out, thus making it more conducive to the projects we take on.

## Instaling the Pipeline
Barnyard Games uses a CI/CD pipeline setup that needs to be installed and setup before any work can be completed. Take a look at this [setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEnNjNakXT8) for more information.
