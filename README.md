# Barnyard Scraps
Heavy backend system for creating [Barnyard Games](https://www.roblox.com/groups/11323634/Barnyard-Games#!/about)' projects. A robust system that should make development on games much quicker with UI presets, game presets, and more. Powered by [Knit](https://github.com/Sleitnick/Knit) and [Nevermore](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine).

## Instaling the Pipeline
Barnyard Games uses a CI/CD pipeline setup that needs to be installed and setup before any work can be completed. Take a look at this [setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEnNjNakXT8) for more information.
