# Barnyard Scraps
## About
Heavy backend system for creating [Barnyard Games](https://www.roblox.com/groups/11323634/Barnyard-Games#!/about) projects. A robust system that should make development on games much quicker with UI presets, game presets, and more. Powered by [Knit](https://github.com/Sleitnick/Knit), [Nevermore](https://github.com/Quenty/NevermoreEngine), and [Fusion](https://github.com/elttob/Fusion). The general idea is that as time goes on, the more games that are developed via the Scraps system, the more that this backend will be fleshed out, thus making it more conducive and efficient for the projects we take on.

## Instaling the Pipeline
Barnyard Games uses a CI/CD pipeline setup that needs to be installed and setup before any work can be completed. Take a look at this [setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEnNjNakXT8) for more information.

## Team-Create Sessions
At the present moment, there is no way to work within the same studio experience and connect to Rojo from more than one account. To combat this, we currently use a live-share system through Visual Studio Code. This requires installing the live-share plugin. The host of the session starts a live-share session and shares that link with any fellow collaborators. The host of the session then connects to Rojo in the shared experience space. They can then edit the same place-file together. 

## Forking Your Own Session
You're more than welcome to fork your own session for individual contribution, but you must disable your git workflows so as not to mess up any staging PlaceIds.
